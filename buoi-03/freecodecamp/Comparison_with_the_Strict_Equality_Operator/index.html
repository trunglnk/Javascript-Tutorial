    <title>Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator</title>
</head>
<body>
<!--Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==).
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type,
the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.-->

  function testStrict(val) {
    if (val === 7) {
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
